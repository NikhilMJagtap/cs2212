### Warehouse Management System  
This project is a warehouse management system which facilitates buying and selling of items. The main objective of this project was not to create any system which can be used but to implement design patterns and architecture. This project can be a very helpful to understand how design patterns can be used in real life scenarios.

The documentation can be found in same repository.

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the code written previously.</li>
  <li>Completing the project as per given specifications.</li>
  <li>Implementing appropriate design patterns.</li>
  <li>Drawinig UML diagrams for use cases.</li>
</ul>


### More
I cannot maintain this repo for a while now. This might be my last commit to this repository. Of course I will fix if there is any issue which might come up. Can't say for sure. I might rework this entire repo as well, if I feel it necessard xD. With that said, I have another repository which is only for design patterns and you might like to have look in case, you can find that [here](https://github.com/NikhilMJagtap/DesignPatternsInCpp).
